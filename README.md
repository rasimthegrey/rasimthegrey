Thanks to my problem-solving skills, analytical thinking skills and my tendency to teamwork, I can work effectively in projects. I aim to provide solutions based on DevOps principles that combine flexibility and reliability in an environment that encourages continuous improvement and automation by using innovative technologies and to develop myself more in this field.
